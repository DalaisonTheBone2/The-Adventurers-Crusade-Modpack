# The-Adventurers-Crusade-Modpack
Development for The Adventurers Crusade modpack

This mod pack is a kingdom-building high fantasy rpg-based mod pack that builds off the base game but adds its own uniqueness. With the texture packs, the original mobs, and the armour sets, you could spend 1,000 hours in this game without even touching the surface of everything that lies inside. It is heavy on exploration and building and incentivizes exploring chests and dungeons for new loot since all the loot tables have been customised. Not only that, but all the minibosses and regular bosses added have unique models and attacks, and the original ones have a fun twist as well. As you go through this dragon-infested, weapon-filled, and biome-overloaded world, you will have tonnes of fun due to the fact that it quite literally never ends. Welcome to The Adventurer's Crusade.

This pack is in alpha and things are subject to change.
playtesting will start soon.
